# Arts Education Patron

The purpose of this project is to try and create a portfolio and freelance work exchange for early artists and their support network.

## Inspiration
The insparation for this service came from my spouse. She has an artistic interest but has never found the time to focus
on skill. She thought she would kill two birds with one stone by offering custom commissions to friends and family for a
painting on canvas for any amount as a donation to her visual design education. The way it worked, you checked if she had
any availability, she would confirm and then the 'patron' drop shipped the canvas to her house. She paints something often
with a room in your house as inspiration and then delivers the painting to the patron. After the patron has the painting
they venmo back a donation of whatever amount they feel comfortable with to the artist. The artist gets both funding
to further their education, and a reason to make time for hours of work developing their skill. The Patron gets both the 
charitable feeling of supporting arts in the community and an original artwork with context to display or offer to others.

## Future Goals
For this project to be useful to our community there needs to be a social distribution method. It should be simple enough to hook into FB, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram to be able to publish artist artworks and patrons to publish commissions they like to their feed. However that is beyond the scope of our MVP. I'd like to tackle it as it's integral for both parties to get the most out of the service.
